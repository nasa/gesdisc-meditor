Users who use search interfaces, including Giovanni, will have issues discovering cloud-enabled data that have been archived in the past couple of days. This is not impacting users who directly access and download data from on-premises archive hosts at the GES DISC. We plan to resolve this issue and resume granule ingest by Sunday, December 31, 2023, though this is subject to change.</p>\n"
