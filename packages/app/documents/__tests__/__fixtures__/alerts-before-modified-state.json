        "body": "<pre wrap=\"\">From TSDIS/PPS Help Desk:Dear Science User,PPS is now producing operational PR data from June 19, 2009 through present using new calibration coefficients from JAXA. The new calibration is valid for times after the switch to PR-B operation to recover from the PR anomaly in May, 2009.The post-anomaly data will be showing up on the PPS Public FTP area and on STORM for normal orders very soon.  We anticipate availability on Monday December 21, 2009 or shortly thereafter.Some PR data was lost and empty granules have been generated for these times.  The empty PR products exist from May, 29, 2009 (orbit 65716) through June, 18, 2009 (orbit 66038).  The first orbit with data after the PR anomaly is June 19, 2009 (orbit 66039).PPS will continue to trend the PR data throughout this post anomaly period.  In addition, JAXA will provide details of the calibration and an assessment of any impacts to data fields in the near future.Please also be aware of the following issue for TRMM PR Level 3 products after TRMM PR switched to the B side:The PR anomaly has caused the loss of PR data from 29 May 2009 to 19 June 2009.  As a result, the June 2009 Level 3 PR products contain only 12 days of data. This makes the June 2009 products less reliable due to the lack of sufficient data upon which to base the statistics.  Please take care when using the June 2009 product for quantitative analysis.Thank you for your patience during this period.Have a great Holiday Season,PPS Help Desk</pre>\n",
