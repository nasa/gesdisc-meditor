## Getting Started

This quick start will guide you through loggin in to mEditor and figuring out what your roles allow you to do. By the end, you should know how to find and view documents within mEditor.

### Logging in

Navigate to the [mEditor URL](https://lb.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/meditor) using your favorite browser. You will be presented with a login prompt, which overlays the Home screen itself. Please login. If you do not have a login, [get one](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthdata-login)!

NOTE: mEditor does NOT have a guest UX. You will not be able edit or publish content without a login.

### mEditor Home Screen

Once logged in, you will see the home screen showing groups of available models. Everything in mEditor is considered a model. A model is essentially a collection of properties or fields that describe a type of document. Each model is represented by a colored icon to uniquely identify it. Beneath each icon is a number in parenthesis which indicates how many documents there are of that model type. Click the icon to view the [list of documents](#viewing-documents) of that model type. You will be able to [edit a document](#editing-a-document-and-submitting-it-for-review) only if you have [permission](#roles) to edit documents of that model type.

The "Admin" group is for creating new models, including users and workflows. It also supports the ability to add or modify roles for existing users. Such actions require special permission beyond that of most mEditor users. For permission to conduct any of the following actions, please submit a bugzilla ticket:

-   Add/modify a model
-   Add/modify a user (includes changing roles)
-   Add/modify a workflow

Make sure to include "mEditor" as the product and select the appropriate component ([https://discette.gsfc.nasa.gov/tt/enter_bug.cgi?product=mEditor](https://discette.gsfc.nasa.gov/tt/enter_bug.cgi?product=mEditor)).

### Determining Your Roles

What you are allowed to do with a document is determined by roles. [Roles](#roles) are assigned to users by model type. For more information on this see [Workflows & Roles](#workflows-and-roles). To find out what permissions you have as a mEditor user do the following:

1. From the [Home screen](#meditor-home-screen) click on the "Users" model.
   ![Users model button](/images/user-guide/quick-start__users-model-button.png)
1. From the list of users, click on your user name.
1. You will see the models and rolls listed.

If you need additional roles for other models, submit a Bugzilla ticket and choose "Meditor" as the product and then select the appropriate component ([https://discette.gsfc.nasa.gov/tt/enter_bug.cgi?product=mEditor](https://discette.gsfc.nasa.gov/tt/enter_bug.cgi?product=mEditor))

### Viewing Documents

To view a list of documents for any of the model types, click on one of the model icon buttons from the [Home screen](#meditor-home-screen). You will be presented with a list of all documents and their current state (Draft, Under Review, Approved or Published). Use [Search](#searching-for-documents) and the "Sort by" control to help you find the document you're looking for. The "+ Add New" button is available if you have the roll of author for a particular model. At the bottom of the page is a control for navigating through the list of documents.
